# Master Boot Record (MBR)

## Definition
A special type of **boot sector** at the very beginning of partitioned computer mass storage devices.

The MBR holds the information on **how the logical partitions, containing file systems, are organized** on that medium. The MBR also contains executable code to function as a loader for the installed operating systemâ€”usually by passing control over to the loader's second stage, or in conjunction with each partition's volume boot record (VBR). This MBR code is usually referred to as a **boot loader**.
