# Master Boot Record (MBR)

## Definition
A special type of **boot sector** at the very beginning of partitioned computer mass storage devices.

The MBR holds the information on **how the logical partitions, containing file systems, are organized** on that medium. The MBR also contains executable code to function as a loader for the installed operating systemâ€”usually by passing control over to the loader's second stage, or in conjunction with each partition's volume boot record (VBR). This MBR code is usually referred to as a **boot loader**.

The (legacy) BIOS checks bootable devices for a boot signature, a so called **magic number**. The boot signature is in a boot sector (sector number 0) and it contains the byte sequence 0x55, 0xAA at byte offsets 510 and 511 respectively.

When the BIOS finds such a boot sector, it is loaded into memory at **0x0000:0x7c00 (segment 0, address 0x7c00)**.

However, some BIOS' load to **0x7c0:0x0000** (segment 0x07c0, offset 0), which resolves to the **same physical address**, but can be surprising. A good practice is to enforce CS:IP at the very start of your boot sector.
