## Definition
QEMU (short for Quick EMUlator) is a free and open-source emulator that performs hardware virtualization.

### System emulation
**In this mode QEMU emulates a full computer system**, including peripherals. It can be used to provide virtual hosting of several virtual computers on a single computer. QEMU can boot many guest operating systems, including Linux, Solaris, Microsoft Windows, DOS, and BSD; it supports emulating several instruction sets, including x86, MIPS, 32-bit ARMv7, ARMv8, PowerPC, SPARC, ETRAX CRIS and MicroBlaze.
